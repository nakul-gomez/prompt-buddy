## 📦 Installation (macOS)

> **Important for Downloaded Builds ⚠️**
> 
> If you downloaded a pre-built app and see "Prompt Buddy is damaged and can't be opened", this is a macOS security feature. The app isn't actually damaged - it just needs to be allowed to run:
> 
> **Option 1: Right-click method**
> 1. Right-click the app and select "Open" 
> 2. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears
> 
> **Option 2: System Settings**
> 1. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
> 2. Look for a message about "Prompt Buddy" and click **"Open Anyway"**
> 
> **Option 3: Terminal method**
> ```bash
> # Replace with your actual app location, typically one of:
> # /Applications/Prompt Buddy.app
> # ~/Downloads/Prompt Buddy.app  
> # ~/Desktop/Prompt Buddy.app
> 
> xattr -cr "/Applications/Prompt Buddy.app"
> ```

## 🛠 Development

Prompt Picker is built with:

- [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/) – cross-platform desktop framework
- [React](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) – pixel-perfect icons

### Code Signing (macOS Distribution)

To distribute the app without the "damaged" error, you need to code sign and notarize:

1. **Get a Developer ID Certificate**
   - Join the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) ($99/year)
   - Create a "Developer ID Application" certificate in Xcode or Developer Portal

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in your actual values:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Then edit .env with your certificate details
   ```
   
   Or export them in your shell:
   ```bash
   export APPLE_CERTIFICATE_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"
   export APPLE_ID="your-apple-id@example.com"
   export APPLE_PASSWORD="app-specific-password"
   export APPLE_TEAM_ID="YOUR_TEAM_ID"
   ```

4. **Build with Code Signing**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```

The resulting app will be properly signed and notarized, eliminating the security warning.
